      My name is Tim, a Software
      Engineer graduated in Computer
      Science. Right after the COVID
      lockdown (March 2020), I began
      studying the React.js. After one
      month of practice, I started my
      software engineer journey as an
      intern intern at Kollective One (a
      startup where I do everything).
