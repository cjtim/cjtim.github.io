  After going back and forth on email,
  receiving my professor's
  recommendation, and having a
  face-to-face interview, I'm in! Of
  course, I started my first day at home
  (due to Covid lockdown again ðŸ˜‚)

  <br />
  <br />

   Got in right on time, in the middle of
  a new product launch, A lot of design reviews,
  implemented the new product, moved the
  repository to GitLab CI, and participated
  in coding reviews. Even though I'm still
  an intern, my team believes in me, and
  any ideas I told are considered. COOL!
